# Data mining for reddit

This is a project done for a Social Sciences Data Analytics course, due June 2021. Focus is less on the complexity of the analysis and more on data mining & social insights/storytelling.

The analysis involves the following:

- **Web scraping** using the Reddit API and PRAW
- **NLP data preprocessing**
- **Supervised learning** with very basic ML algorithm development
- Interpreting results


----------------

The aim is to explore whether Reddit has been able to safeguard free speech, and if it has remained free of any degree of polarization which may repel or deter potential users from expressing their opinions. Thus, in this notebook, we explore whether this platform has gotten more politically biased during the last few years; that is, to have an exploratory analysis of whether posts, in general, have gotten more left-winged, right-winged, or perhaps apolitical.
