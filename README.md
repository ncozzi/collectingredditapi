**ncozzi/ncozzi** is a repository of some random projects that I have worked on

- *Data mining for reddit* (datamining_reddit): project done for a social sciences Stats class <br/>
Involves mining posts from subreddits, and doing basic, exploratory NLP prediction using generic tuned models

- *Mapping world precipitations* (geopandas_precip): using geopandas for plotting monthly mean temperatures, from 1990 to 2021, across the globe; involves processing gridded N-dimensional (latitude x longitude x time) datafiles, data wrangling, and geopandas plotting

- *Predicting GDP growth with World Bank data* (wb_gdp_predict): in this project, WB data is pulled via the website's API, then Machine Learning models are created for GDP prediction (one-year-forward), after the respective data wrangling/cleaning, outlier detection, etcetera; a proper approach is considered for longitudinal data

- *Testing LDA for topic modeling in The Guardian sports news* (the_guardian_lda.ipynb): testing the stability of Latent Dirichlet Allocation for topic modeling, applied to The Guardian sports news from Q1 and Q2 2022
