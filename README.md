**ncozzi/ncozzi** is a repository of some random projects that I have worked on

- *Data mining for reddit* (datamining_reddit): project done for a social sciences Stats class <br/>
Involves mining posts from subreddits, and doing basic NLP prediction using generic tuned models

- *Mapping world precipitations* (geopandas_precip): using geopandas for plotting monthly mean temperatures, from 1990 to 2021, across the globe; involves processing gridded N-dimensional (latitude x longitude x time) datafiles, data wrangling, and geopandas plotting
